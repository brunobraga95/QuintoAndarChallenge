This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This Repository contains a challenge proposed by the recruiting team from [QuintoAndar](https://www.quintoandar.com.br).. Feel Free to clone it and use as you wish.


## Requirements

* node `^4.5.0`
* yarn `^0.17.0` or npm `^3.0.0`

## Getting Started

After confirming that your development environment meets the specified requirements you can run the project by doing the following:

### Install from source

First, clone the project and then install dependencies. I:

It is recommended that you use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for deterministic installs, but `npm install` will work just as well.

```bash
$ yarn install    # Install project dependencies
$ yarn start      # Compile and launch (same as `npm serve`)

|`npm run <script>`|Description|
|------------------|-----------|
|`start`|Starts a production bundle.|
|`serve`|Serves your app at `localhost:3000`. HMR will be enabled in development.|
|`compile`|Compiles the application to disk (`~/dist` by default).|
|`dev`|Same as `npm start`, but enables nodemon for the server as well.|
|`dev:no-debug`|Same as `npm run dev` but disables devtool instrumentation.|
|`test`|Runs unit tests with Karma and generates a coverage report.|
|`test:dev`|Runs Karma and watches for changes to re-run tests; does not generate coverage reports.|
